# Tabula Rasa

This project's goal is to create a WordPress plugin. This plugin will help wedding planners assign guests to available table seats within a venue.

At WordPress admin, the user can generate the required tables with different numbers of seats. Also, the user can assign the tables’ location given a venue space reference.

At Frontend, the user can assign the guest list or individual guests to the tables given the available seats.


### WP admin

The plugin adds three custom post-types: table, venue, and guest.

#### ‘table’

This custom post-type handles the table data. The tables required are created on the ‘Tabula Rasa’ settings page.

#### ‘venue’

This custom post-type handles the venue space reference as a background image. The venue is generated as a custom post-type entry. Currently, the system handles only one venue space. If necessary, the venue spaces could be more than one.

#### ‘guest’

This custom post-type handles the guests' data. The guest lists are taken from WP plugin Ninja Forms data. Eventually, the plugin will also take data from WP plugin RSVP.


### Frontend

The guest lists will be generated by gathering the data created by the Ninja Forms registers.

The venue space will be displayed with the tables. The tables will be placed at the location given on the “Tabula Rasa” settings page.

The guest lists will be dragged and dropped into the tables. The guests can be separated from the list or the assigned table.
